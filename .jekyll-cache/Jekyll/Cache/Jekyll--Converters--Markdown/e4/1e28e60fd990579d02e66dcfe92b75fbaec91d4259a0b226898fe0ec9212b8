  <li>I’m fascinated about language related technologies and I have spent a lot of time self studying machine learning techniques to solve language problems. I converse fluently in English, Mandarin and Cantonese, and write programs mainly in Python nowadays. You can read <a href="../My-Story-with-Language">my story about language</a> to know more about my language learning journey.</li>

    <p>Academic degrees in Computer Science and Economics and past experiences have helped me acquire tremendous data analytics techniques and methodologies, and provided me with a solid foundation to dive deeper in research and applications in today’s big data challenges. Analysing financial, economical, and industry data and come up with a solid understanding and view is one of the basic technical skills needed to fulfill my duties in the past, and it sometimes requires financial modeling skill, which is usually done in Excel spreadsheet.</p>

    <p>I spent 2+ years working on training ML models for one of the leading chatbots and it opened a new career path for me by chance. I started to know NLU, NLP, chatbot, how machine learning algorithms help solve some of the problems, and how data quality affects the performance of a model, and I’m glad I acquired all these knowledge from hands on experiences. Computer Science background and professional working experiences helped me quickly excel from my last position and got me promoted to assume a leading role in ML model training.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Prior to be bitten by the NLP and AI bug, I have established a fruitful career in banking and finance and have had years of professional experiences in Singapore and Hong Kong. Those jobs required well-rounded skills and provided me with great exposure and learning opportunity to the professional world, and it has definitely helped me in various ways during my adventure in the tech industry, although it seems irrelevant.</p>
