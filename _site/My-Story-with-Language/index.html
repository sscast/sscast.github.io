    <p>My life has had a close relationship with many languages, and I have benefited from knowing multiple languages.</p>

<h1 id="learn-english-and-computer-languages">learn english and computer languages</h1>
<p>I was born speaking only Mandarin, and I started to learn English in secondary school, at age of 11, at my time when it was a mandatory class in school. I picked up Cantonese when I worked in Hong Kong (in my mid 20s) after my degrees. I studied computer science in college, where I learnt different kinds of programming languages. Object Oriented Programming started to gain its popularity when I was in college, so I can embark on OOP and OOD philosophies and made my journey now easier.</p>

<h1 id="impove-english-and-mandarin">impove english and mandarin</h1>
<p>I did translation and tutoring (Chinese) part time jobs when I was in college and between my degrees to make some pocket money. It turns out to become a process for me to improve my multilingual skills. After college, when I started to look for jobs, one of the main reasons I got my first job was because I speak mandarin, because a big clientele was from mainland China. After I moved to Hong Kong, the connection with mainland China became stronger, in other words, high profile clients and big deals, so being multilingual was more important to me. Completely separate English and Chinese was a big challenge I had to solve when I had to face clients, because they don’t speak English at all. I can’t use English words when I speak mandarin. Sounds familiar?</p>

<h1 id="learn-cantonese-and-improve-over-years">learn cantonese and improve over years</h1>
<p>I was a fan of Cantonese, so I took the advantage of being physically in Hong Kong and learnt how to speak Cantonese. By the time I left Hong Kong, I was very comfortable conversing in Cantonese, but I had some difficutlties of writing/typing it. To me, it’s hard to find the right word corresponding to Cantonese when it comes to text. However, when I worked at one of the big names in Silicon Valley, having to look at huge of amount of Cantonese sentences every day, suddenly, I realized I can type and write Cantonese without a problem. Again, one of the reasons I got this job was because I speak Mandarin and I know computer language, and one of the reasons I got promoted afterwards was because I know Cantonese, so I was paid to pick up some technologies because of my language skills. Why not?</p>

<h1 id="short-summary">short summary</h1>
<p>Throughout these years, I didn’t take classes to learn these languages (other than mandatory classes in school). The only language I took classes to learn was French but I gave up after the beginner’s level. The fact that I didn’t use it after class gave me a lot of pain to attend class too. So, my experiences proved the powerfulness of life long learning and on the job learning.</p>

<h1 id="driven-force">driven force</h1>
<p>What I have achieved is probably quite amazing to some people, but when I went through my life, the driven force was not big ambitions or egos, but simple wishes that I wanted to know more about it or I wanted my life to become easier so I can communicate with others better. Meanwhile, I kept an open mind when it comes to new opportunities and not to set boundaries to myself as to what I can do. Being able to work with smart people and interact with high profile clients provided me great opportunities to learn, and I’ve seen a lot others who have done better and mastered more languages. I decided to share my story here in the hope that it might become inspiration to someone.</p>

<h1 id="whats-next">what’s next?</h1>
<p>Looking back, I personally have benefited from the language skills and the more I know about a language, the more I realize that there is an amazing culture behind it. With globalization and technology advancement, we cannot stop the fact some less popular language will get even less popular. How we use technology to “preserve” it is something I’m very fascinated about. For example, one day in the future, you want to to know how to say something in one ancient language or dialect, rather than digging into some history and linguistic books(and probably given up before you find an answer), if you can simply ask “somebody”, then you can get your answer immediately. This sounds really great and make me excited! With fascination like that, I started to answer questions on Stack Exchange about Chinese language related questions. And I have also tried to know more about technologies that I can use to help me achieve this. I’m glad to make baby steps everyday. Again, I don’t want to set boundaries to what I can do in the future with what I’m doing right now, and I’m open to new opportunities that I can contribute and learn.</p>
